# Intelligent Inspection Web Application - Development Notes

## Project Overview
Building a responsive web application using React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend) for an Intelligent Inspection system.

## Project Structure
- Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS, ShadCN/UI, and other dependencies
- Backend: FastAPI with necessary endpoints

## Progress Tracking

### Initial Setup (Completed)
- Created basic project structure
- Set up frontend and backend directories
- Planning component architecture

### Frontend Development (Completed)
- Set up React application with required dependencies
- Configured Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- Created component structure:
  - Header component with application title and icons
  - Navigation component with sidebar icons
  - Home page with process list and inspection summary
  - Process detail page with video stream and sensor status
  - Analytics page with device list and sensor line chart
  - Settings page with placeholder UI
- Implemented responsive design for various screen sizes
- Added animations and interactive elements

### Backend Development (Completed)
- Set up FastAPI application with CORS middleware
- Created API endpoints:
  - /api/home/process-list - Returns list of inspection processes
  - /api/home/inspection-summary - Returns inspection statistics
  - /api/process/detail/{process_id} - Returns detailed process information
- Implemented Pydantic models for data validation
- Added mock data for development and testing

### Next Steps
- Connect frontend to backend API
- Implement WebRTC for video streaming
- Add user authentication
- Implement real-time data updates
- Add database integration

## Key Findings & Decisions
- Using a modular approach to separate concerns between frontend and backend
- Following the specified purple theme with interactive elements
- Implementing responsive design for various screen sizes
- Using mock data for development and testing
- Adding loading states and error handling for better user experience

# Project Progress and Findings

## Frontend Issues

### Problem: Missing public directory and index.html
- Error: "Could not find a required file. Name: index.html Searched in: /home/koshy/code/cursortemp2/frontend/public"
- Solution: Created the public directory and added the necessary files:
  - index.html - Main HTML template for the React application
  - manifest.json - Web app manifest for PWA support
  - favicon.ico, logo192.png, logo512.png - Placeholder icon files

### Problem: Running npm start from incorrect directory
- Error: "Could not read package.json: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/koshy/code/cursortemp2/backend/frontend/package.json'"
- Solution: Started the npm server from the correct directory path: `/home/koshy/code/cursortemp2/frontend`

### Problem: Empty page with no content
- Issue: The React application was loading but showing an empty page
- Potential causes:
  1. API calls failing due to backend not running
  2. Missing Tailwind CSS configuration
  3. Component rendering issues
- Solution:
  1. Created postcss.config.js to ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured
  2. Modified components to use mock data by default instead of trying to fetch from the API
  3. Restarted the frontend server to apply changes

### Changes Made:
1. Created the public directory structure: `mkdir -p frontend/public`
2. Created index.html with standard React template
3. Created manifest.json with application metadata
4. Added placeholder icon files to avoid warnings
5. Created postcss.config.js for Tailwind CSS configuration
6. Modified Home.js and ProcessDetail.js to use mock data by default
7. Started the frontend development server from the correct directory
8. Verified the server is running by accessing http://localhost:3000

### Current Status:
- Frontend server is running successfully on port 3000
- The React application is now accessible via browser with content displayed

## Backend Issues

### Problem: Module import errors
- Error: "Error loading ASGI app. Could not import module 'main'"
- Potential causes:
  1. Running the command from the wrong directory
  2. Missing main.py file
  3. Python version compatibility issues with FastAPI and pydantic

### Next Steps for Backend:
1. Verify the location of main.py
2. Check Python version compatibility
3. Consider creating a virtual environment with compatible versions

## Overall Project Structure
- Frontend: React application with standard structure (now running with mock data)
- Backend: FastAPI application with potential configuration issues (still needs fixing)
